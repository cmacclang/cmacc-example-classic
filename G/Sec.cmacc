// Sec.* is the sections of the agreement - the principal text.  There is an option for a heading, but that is rare.  We also include a default set of top-level subject matter divisions.  Sec_Div defaults to Sec - which makes it easy to use the large set of paragraph widgets.

$ Sec = "Section"

$ sec = "section"
